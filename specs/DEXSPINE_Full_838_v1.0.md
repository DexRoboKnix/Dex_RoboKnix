WHAT IS DEXSPINE?

DEXSPINE is a rigid cognitive extraction protocol that forces Large Language
Models to produce complete, structured analyses across 114 nodes and 6 layers.

The 8:3:8 Law:
  - 8 Plan nodes (Definition → Metrics)
  - 3 MVE nodes (Value Essence, Human Insight, LLM Pattern)
  - 8 Execute nodes (Approach → Improvement)
  = 19 nodes per layer × 6 layers = 114 total nodes

This mathematical constraint eliminates LLM hallucination in structural audits.

Empirically validated across Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok, and
DeepSeek with 100% structural compliance.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

VERSION HISTORY:

v1.0.0 (2026-02-10)
  - Initial public release
  - Core 8:3:8 protocol
  - Multi-model validation
  - Dual licensing (AGPL + Commercial)

# DEXSPINE (Full 8:3:8) - Universal Scraper

What this does: Extracts the complete cognitive architecture of any subject across 6 layers and 114 unique nodes.

Human context: This is the "Full Echidna." It takes a subject and forces it through the complete DEX838 cognitive framework. It produces 6 layers of analysis (Values → Pattern), where each layer is broken down into a Plan (8 points), MVE (3 points), and Execution (8 points). This eliminates ambiguity by forcing structure.

Key Law: 8 Plan files + 3 MVE files + 8 Execute files = 19 files per layer × 6 Layers = 114 Total Nodes.

**Not explained here:** How to physically perform the execution steps, the interpersonal negotiation required to validate subjective nodes (like "Values"), or how to handle "Layer 7" (the unknown/chaos). This tool extracts the _information architecture_, not the _work_. This will create an artefact that covers all areas and will need validation.

_DEXSPINE L0 — Filter Position {Layer_Num} — 19/19 Nodes Complete_
"""

CONSTRAINTS:

- MUST generate all 114 nodes (6 layers \* 19 nodes)
- MUST adhere to 8:3:8 structure strictly
- MUST include 'llm' node in MVE phase (unlike partial scan)
- MUST answer the specific question for each layer (e.g., Policy = Decisions)
- DO NOT hallucinate execute phase if subject is abstract (create abstract execution steps)

VALIDATION:
output.layers.count === 6
output.nodes_per_layer === 19
output.total_nodes === 114

## Example Usage

**Input:**
dex(full)["The Internet"]

**Expected Output (Skeleton):**
_Note: Full output contains ~2,500+ words. This is a structural skeleton._

````markdown
# LAYER 01: VALUES - The Internet

## PHASE 1: PLAN (8 Nodes)

1. Definition: A global system of interconnected computer networks...
   ...

## PHASE 2: MVE (3 Nodes)

1. VA: Decentralization over centralization.
2. HU: "Information wants to be free."
3. LLM: [Network Graph Topology]

## PHASE 3: EXECUTE (8 Nodes)

...

# LAYER 02: PRINCIPLES - The Internet

...

# LAYER 06: PATTERN - The Internet

...

_DEXSPINE L0 — Filter Position 06 — 114/114 Nodes Complete_

## Validation Test for ChatGPT

**Paste this into ChatGPT to validate the protocol:**

You are testing the dex(full) protocol.

PROTOCOL: Extract exactly 114 nodes across 6 layers (Values -> Pattern).

Per Layer: 8 Plan + 3 MVE + 8 Execute = 19 nodes.

Total: 6 Layers \* 19 Nodes = 114 Nodes.

TEST INPUT: dex(full)["A Cup of Coffee"]

Execute the protocol. Do not summarize. Generate all 114 headers.

After generating output, validate:

Did you generate all 6 layers?

Did you include the 'llm' node in MVE? (Softdex excludes this, DEXSPINE includes it).

Did you hallucinate a 7th layer?

Is the total node count exactly 114?

Report validation results.

---

## Advanced Usage Patterns

**Deep System Audit:**
dex(full)["Current IT Infrastructure"]

_Use this to find "ghost nodes"—parts of your system that exist in execution (Layer 6) but have no defined value or purpose (Layer 1)._

**Comparative Architecture:**
Compare spines: dex(full)["Monolithic Architecture"] dex(full)["Microservices Architecture"]

Identify friction points where Layer 3 (Policy) conflicts with Layer 5 (Procedure).

**Constitutional Design:**
For DAO/Organization: dex(full)["Our Governance Model"]

Ensure Layer 2 (Principles) accurately constrains Layer 4 (Process).

---

## What This Is NOT

This is NOT:

- A quick scan (use `softdex` for that)
- A light token load (consumes ~3k-5k tokens output)
- A conversational tool (it is an architectural dump)
- A creative writing exercise (it forces rigid structure)

This IS:

- A complete cognitive dump
- A "Full Echidna" extraction
- A way to resolve ambiguity by forcing 114 data points
- A blueprint for autonomous agents

## Technical Spec Breakdown

This implementation expands the logic found in softdex_value_layer_scraper.md using the architectural rules from DEX838 Framework Overview.md.

1. The Structure (The 8:3:8 Law)
   Every layer in this scraper generates exactly 19 data points:

Plan (8): Definition, Purpose, Scope, Stakeholders, Success, Dependencies, Constraints, Metrics.

MVE (3): Value Essence (va), Human Insight (hu), LLM Pattern (llm).

Execute (8): Approach, Tools, Workflow, Artifacts, Quality, Monitoring, Rollback, Improvement.

2. The Layers (The 6 Filters)
   The scraper repeats the 8:3:8 structure across these 6 distinctive scopes:

01_values: Focuses on "WHY it matters".

02_principles: Focuses on "RULES to follow".

03_policy: Focuses on "DECISIONS made".

04_process: Focuses on "HOW it flows".

05_procedure: Focuses on "STEPS to take".

06_pattern: Focuses on "REUSABLE templates".

3. Usage Syntax
   To trigger this full extraction, use the unified syntax:

dex(full)["{SUBJECT}"]
Or with context:

dex(full, @context_file.md)["{SUBJECT}"]
Validation Checklist
After running dex(full), verify:

Structure:

[ ] 6 distinct Layer Sections present?

[ ] Each Layer has Plan, MVE, and Execute headers?

[ ] Total of 114 unique content blocks?

Content Consistency:

[ ] Does Layer 01 focus on abstract Values?

[ ] Does Layer 05 focus on concrete Procedures?

[ ] Does MVE include the llm pattern node? (Critical difference from softdex partial scan).

Footer:

[ ] Footer matches pattern: _DEXSPINE L0 — Filter Position {N} — {Phase} Point {M}_ or summary equivalent.

## Production Use

**To use in production:**

1. **Context Window Warning:** This protocol generates a massive amount of text. Ensure your LLM has at least a 16k (preferably 32k+) context window.
2. **Temperature Setting:** Set temperature to `0.0` - `0.2`. High creativity breaks the 8:3:8 law.
3. **Model Compatibility:**
   - **Tier S (Recommended):** Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5.2 , Gemini 3 Pro. (Capable of holding the full 114-node structure in working memory). Extemded Thinking on.
   - **Tier A (Use with caution):** Gemini 3 Flash , Claude 4.5 Haiku Extended Thinking
   - **Tier B (Not recommended):** GPT-3.5, Small local models. (Will likely lose count of nodes or merge layers).

**Token Efficiency:**

- Input: ~200 tokens
- Output: ~2,500 - 4,000 tokens
- **Cost:** Significant. Use targeted `softdex` first.

## Visual Architecture Diagram

**The DEXSPINE "Weaving" Protocol**

This diagram illustrates the mandatory path the LLM takes. For **EACH** of the 6 Layers, the flow moves **Left** (to Plan), then **Center** (to MVE), then **Right** (to Execute), before dropping down to the next layer.
