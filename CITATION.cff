abstract: >
  DEXSPINE is a rigid cognitive extraction protocol that forces Large 
  Language Models to produce complete, structured analyses across 114 
  nodes and 6 architectural layers. It eliminates hallucination in 
  structural audits by enforcing mathematical constraints: 8 Plan + 
  3 MVE + 8 Execute = 19 nodes per layer × 6 layers = 114 total nodes.
  The protocol has been empirically validated across four frontier 
  models (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) with 100% 
  structural compliance.
